# Theano-and-Lasagne
Neural networks with Theano and Lasagne

==================

## Theano basics 
 - Symbolic variables/tensors, expressions
 - Functions, shared variables and updates

## Overview of Lasagne 
 - Layer classes and building a network
 - Objectives, optimizers, and training

## Convolutional neural networks 
 - Image classification
 - Fine-tuning a pretrained network
 - Style transfer (“Neural Art”)

## Recurrent neural networks 
 - Language model (text generation)
 - CNN + RNN (image captioning)

## Extending Lasagne 
 - Defining custom Layers
